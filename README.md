# Nodium
Bypassing Medium paywall with ease ðŸŽ‰

Nodium automatically detects if the site is powered by Medium, and does its "magic" (delete tracking cookies set by Medium) to bypass the paywall ðŸ¤©
Note: You'll not be able to log in to Medium when the extension is activated. Please disable the extension first and re-enable it later.

## UPDATE:

It now may only work for free articles. For articles behind the paywall, you have to consider other options, ex: https://freedium.cfd/
